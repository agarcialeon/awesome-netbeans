# Considerations <a name="considerations"></a>

There is always a posibility that this repository becomes outdated, mostly because new resources or plugins appear in the future. This is because of the nature of technlogy and this can be avoided, so in order to keep this project as updated as possible with what other users know, please create a new issue to include or remove what you think is necessary.

Another point is the categorization of the resources provided here. Since some of them can be included in different categories at the same time a cross reference will be created in the form of a hastag to notify you (the visitor) that maybe you need to look in a different place of this repository or in other external site to find more info.

I hope all of you find this helpful. Let's go with the contents.
